                    Design is universal. We all live and work in the built world, and every object, system and environment in the built world has been designed. Clever is a podcast about design. Well, actually, it's about designers, too. Sure, they're visionaries, problem-solvers, critical thinkers, rebels and aesthetes, but above all, they're human. <br><br>
                    This mini-episode is an extension of the usual Amy & Jaime post-interview debrief and a venture into the murky waters of social media.
